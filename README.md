## Project Overview

This project involved a series of tasks related to data retrieval and analysis using various APIs and websites.

### Task 1: Red Eléctrica de España API
Explore the [FREE API](https://www.ree.es/en/apidatos) to retrieve data on electricity sources and market prices. Specific queries included obtaining types of electricity sources, calculating wind and solar power percentages for certain regions and dates, and analyzing monthly power evolution.

### Task 2: NASA API - Astronomy Picture of the Day
Utilize the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to obtain information on the Astronomy Picture of the Day. Queries were designed to get the current day's image, the image of a specific day, and a set of images for a user-specified time period.

### Task 3: Movie Comparison - Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb
Compare the top movies of 2022 according to [Rotten Tomatoes](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/100-best-classic-movies/) and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&year=2022-01-01,2022-12-31). DataFrames were created for each platform, and common movies were identified through cross-referencing.

### Task 4: eBay Market Study with SerpApi
Conduct a market study on eBay using [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/ebay-search-api) to search for Samsung smartphones in the Spanish domain. Key information was organized in a DataFrame, and statistics, including minimum and maximum prices and a price histogram, were presented.
